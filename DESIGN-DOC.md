# Design Document: Distributed Task Scheduler

## Introduction
The distributed task scheduler is a system designed to allow clients to register tasks with specific execution times or using cron syntax for recurring tasks. The system ensures that tasks are picked up and executed within 10 seconds of their scheduled time of execution. This document outlines the critical design decisions, components, services, and communications of the system.

## Core Components

### Task Registration Service
Responsible for handling task registrations from clients. It validates and stores the tasks in a database.

### Task Scheduler
Monitors the registered tasks and schedules them for execution based on their type (one-time or recurring) and execution time.

### Task Executor
Executes the scheduled tasks within 10 seconds of their scheduled time. It communicates with external systems if necessary to perform the task.

### Task Logging Service
Logs executed tasks along with their execution times. Provides a separate view in the UI to display the logged tasks.

## High-Level Design

### High Availability
- Use redundant instances of Task Scheduler and Task Executor to ensure high availability.

### Scaling Up and Down suggestions
- **Scaling Up**: Add more instances of Task Scheduler and Task Executor to handle increased task load. Use auto-scaling mechanisms to automatically adjust the number of instances based on workload.
- **Scaling Down**: Remove instances when the workload decreases to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs.

### Cost-Effectiveness suggestions
- Use cost-effective cloud services for hosting components, such as AWS EC2 instances and RDS databases. Utilize spot instances and reserved capacity to save costs.
- Optimize resource usage by scaling components dynamically based on workload. Monitor resource usage and adjust capacity as needed.

### Chokepoints suggestions
- The Task Scheduler may become a chokepoint as the number of registered tasks increases. Implement efficient task scheduling algorithms and distributed task queues to handle large numbers of tasks efficiently.
- Database performance may degrade under heavy load. Use caching mechanisms and database optimizations to improve performance and scalability.

### Tradeoffs
- **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: Strive for simplicity in design while balancing the need for scalability and reliability. Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.
- **Performance vs. Cost**: Optimize performance without significantly increasing costs. Use cost-effective solutions wherever possible while ensuring acceptable performance levels.

## Prototype
The prototype will be implemented using TypeScript and React, providing a GUI for task registration, scheduling, and execution. It will include features to create one-time and recurring tasks, log executed tasks, and display the current list of scheduled tasks. Detailed instructions for running the solution, preferably using Docker, will be provided.

This design document outlines the critical components, high-level design decisions, tradeoffs, and scalability considerations of the distributed task scheduler. It provides a roadmap for the development of the system and ensures that key design aspects are addressed effectively.
